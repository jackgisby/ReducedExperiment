\usage{
plot_stability(
  stability,
  plot_path = NULL,
  stability_threshold = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{stability}{The results of \link[ReducedExperiment]{estimate_stability}.}

\item{plot_path}{The path at which the plot will be saved}

\item{stability_threshold}{Plots a stability threshold, below which
components can be pruned by \link[ReducedExperiment]{run_ica}.}

\item{mean_stability_threshold}{Plots a stability threshold, which is used
by \link[ReducedExperiment]{estimate_stability} to estimate the optimal
number of components.}

\item{height}{The height of the plot, to be passed to \link[ggplot2]{ggsave}.}

\item{width}{The width of the plot, to be passed to \link[ggplot2]{ggsave}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \link[ggplot2]{ggsave}.}
